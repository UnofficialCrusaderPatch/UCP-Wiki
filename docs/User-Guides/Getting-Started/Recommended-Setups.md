# Recommended Setups

New to the UCP and not sure where to start? Here are some recommended plugins and setups to try, curated for different gameplay experiences. You can find all of these in the **Store** tab of the UCP GUI.

## For the Purist: The Vanilla+ Experience

This setup aims to preserve the original feel of Stronghold Crusader while fixing bugs and adding subtle improvements.

* **UCP Default Plugin:** This is the absolute bare minimum. It applies crucial bug fixes and enables the UCP framework but makes almost no changes to gameplay. This is the most vanilla-like experience possible.
* **Vanilla Retraced Unlocked:** A complete overhaul of the vanilla experience. The Skirmish Trail is upgraded with stronger AI and improved castles, some vanilla maps are replaced with better versions, and the AI is stronger overall. It's the way vanilla was meant to be played.

## For the Challenger: A Fierce AI Experience

Ready for a real fight? This setup turns the AI into relentless and intelligent opponents.

* **Xander's Plug and Play:** This plugin provides one of the fiercest AI fighting experiences available. It comes with a selection of excellent maps and configures the UCP to make the AI hyper-aggressive and strategically sound. Be prepared.

## For the Explorer: A Total Conversion

Experience Stronghold Crusader in a completely new way with this immersive total conversion.

* **Legends of the Orient by Crusader Pilaw:** The current crown jewel of UCP content. This plugin replaces all 16 lords with fully custom characters from East Asian history, complete with unique personalities, castles, dialogue, and artwork. It includes a brand new, challenging Extreme Skirmish Trail and is expertly balanced. A must-play.

## For the Artist: Graphical Overhauls

Change the look and feel of the game with these high-quality texture packs.

* **Conquering Europe & Conquering Christmas by Monsterfish:** These beautiful texture packs replace the game's visuals with new themes. They can be used with any other gameplay or AI mod.

## For the Competitor: Multiplayer Setup

This plugin provides the most up-to-date and balanced experience for playing with friends or in tournaments.

* **Ascension Multiplayer Plugin:** The standard for competitive UCP multiplayer. It provides a balanced roster of units, a large collection of competitive maps, and ensures all game settings are synchronized between players. It can be used with Steam's multiplayer integration or with GameRanger.
