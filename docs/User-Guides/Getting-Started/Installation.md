# Installation

Installing the UCP is a straightforward process. The framework is designed to be placed directly into your game directory.

## Standard Installation

1.  **Download:** Grab the latest release of the UCP from the official [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/UnofficialCrusaderPatch3/releases). Download the standard (non-developer) version.
2.  **Extract:** Unzip the contents of the downloaded file directly into your main Stronghold Crusader game folder. This is the folder that contains `Stronghold Crusader.exe`.
3.  **Launch:** You can now launch the game as you normally would:
    * Directly via `Stronghold Crusader.exe` or `Stronghold Crusader Extreme.exe`.
    * Through the Steam client's "Play" button.
    * Using the UCP's Graphical User Interface (GUI), which provides access to all patch features.

The UCP automatically hooks into the game at launch.

## Developer Build

The developer build allows you to create and test your own modules with unverified code. It bypasses the security measures that prevent arbitrary code execution, so **only use it for development purposes**.

The installation process is identical to the standard installation, but you download the "Developer" version from the releases page instead.
