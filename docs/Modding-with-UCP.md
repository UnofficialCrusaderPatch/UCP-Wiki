# Modding with UCP

This is the central hub for anyone who wants to create their own content for Stronghold Crusader using the Unofficial Crusader Patch. The UCP is designed to be a powerful and flexible modding framework, allowing you to create anything from a single custom map to a total conversion that changes every aspect of the game.

Modding is distinct from the **[Developer Zone](../Developer-Zone.md)**, which focuses on contributing to the core UCP framework itself. Here, we focus on using the framework to modify the game.

All custom content is packaged as an **Extension**. There are two types:
* **Plugins:** For adding content like maps, AIs, and graphics.
* **Modules:** For modifying game code with scripted logic.
