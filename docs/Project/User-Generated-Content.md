# Roadmap: User-Generated Content

The goal is to encourage, assist, and empower the community to create and share new, high-quality content for the game via the UCP.

---

### New Content Types & Features

-   **Enable Custom Skirmish Trails:** Allow users to create and share their own skirmish trails for both regular Crusader and Crusader Extreme via the UCP store.
    -   As part of this, remove the hardcoded x3 Gold multiplier for the Extreme trail, and optionally allow custom starting goods for individual trail missions.
-   **Support Custom Campaigns:** Implement support for custom historical campaigns.
    -   *Ideal implementation:* A flexible campaign format that can mix skirmish-trail missions, classic scenario missions, and standard skirmish maps into a single campaign progression.
-   **Enable Scenario Events on Skirmish Maps:** This would unlock the potential for co-op multiplayer missions with objectives beyond "kill all other players."

### Modularity & Compatibility

-   **Improve `cr.tex` Handling:** Provide a better system for managing changes to the `cr.tex` file. It's currently impossible for users to merge different mods that both alter this file. The new UCP3 AI format, which handles AI text separately, is a great step in this direction.
-   **Option to Disable Spawners:** Add a global option to disable enemy spawners on all maps, allowing spawner-heavy maps to be played in a standard skirmish setting.
-   **Allow Hiding of Maps:** Give users the ability to hide certain maps (e.g., campaign-only maps) from the skirmish and multiplayer map selection lists to reduce clutter.

### Community Content Curation

-   **Showcase Community Content:** Actively work with content creators to package and release awesome existing community content as official UCP store entries.
    -   *Examples:* Well-regarded map packs, mission packs, AI packs, and texture packs like Monsterfish's "Conquering" series or Salen's "Volcanic" pack.
