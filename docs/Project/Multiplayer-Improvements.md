# Roadmap: Multiplayer Improvements

The primary goal for multiplayer is to make it more accessible, stable, enjoyable, and configurable, allowing different communities to play to their liking.

---

### Quality of Life (QoL) & UI

-   **Lobby Improvements:**
    -   Allow players to **change their color** in the lobby, perhaps via a chat command.
    -   Display a **warning if a player has a different UCP config** than the host.
    -   Enable an option to **sync the hostâ€™s UCP config** with all lobby participants.
    -   Fix issues with player names and chat messages sometimes turning invisible.
-   **In-Game Improvements:**
    -   Provide **improved in-game and end-game statistics**.
    -   Add a **better chat history** display.
    -   Allow the host to **change the game speed** during a match.
-   **Improve the Autosave System:**
    -   Cycle between several autosave slots instead of overwriting one file.
    -   Add player names or timestamps to autosave filenames.
    -   Allow for shorter autosave intervals.

### Stability, Connectivity & New Game Modes

-   **Improve Network Stability:** Investigate and improve the networking code to reduce desyncs. Allow customization of parameters like input latency ("fake lag").
-   **Integrate Steamworks (RedirectPlay):** Polish and fully integrate the existing system for easier lobby discovery and joining directly through Steam.
    -   *Ensure Stability:* Host migration, preventing late-joining, proper handling of private/friends-only lobbies.
    -   *Improve UX:* Better lobby creation/password UI, more info in the lobby search list (player count, running game indicator).
-   **Enable Dynamic Alliances:** Restore the multiplayer lobby option from Stronghold 1 that allows alliances to be changed mid-game.
-   **Implement New Game Modes:**
    -   **King of the Hill:** Restore this game mode from Stronghold 1.
    -   **Ranked Play:** Potentially create a system for ranked games with leaderboards visible on the UCP website.
    -   **2-Player Co-op:** Allow two human players to share control of a single castle/army.
    -   **Multiplayer Scenarios:** Support maps with scripted events and AI opponents that can be played cooperatively.

---

### Community & External Integration

-   **Finish the Replay System:** This is a critical feature for both competitive analysis and content creation.
-   **Provide Better Guidance:** Make information about how to play multiplayer with UCP more available in the GUI, promoting relevant Discords, setups, etc.
-   **Cooperation with the SHCPlayer Mod:** Explore potential cooperation with the creator of this popular mod.
