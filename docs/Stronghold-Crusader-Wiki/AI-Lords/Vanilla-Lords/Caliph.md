## Backstory & Personality
The Caliph is a cruel and devious desert commander with a penchant for fire. He takes sadistic pleasure in watching his enemies' castles burn and uses slaves without remorse to achieve his goals.

## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a more detailed analysis of the Caliph's AIC parameters and build order.

### Economy
The Caliph has a decent Arabian economy, but his main focus is on producing Pitch for his fire-based tactics. He will often sell other goods to ensure a steady supply of pitch and oil.

### Military
His strategy is all about fire. He uses large numbers of Slaves to dig moats and light oil slicks, supported by Fire Throwers. He is notorious for launching devastating fire attacks that can cripple an opponent's castle if they are not prepared with wells or water pots.

### Castle Design
His castles are typically built on high ground if possible, featuring many square towers and walls designed to give his Fire Throwers and Archers good firing positions. He makes extensive use of pitch ditches as a primary defense.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Devastating Fire Attacks:** His use of fire can quickly destroy wooden buildings and halt attacking armies.
* **Strong Psychological Effect:** Watching your castle burn can be demoralizing.

### Weaknesses
* **Vulnerable to Fireproof Units:** His armies are less effective against units that can withstand or bypass fire, like Macemen or Knights.
* **Poor Troop Quality:** His reliance on Slaves and Fire Throwers leaves him with a weak standing army if you can close the distance.
