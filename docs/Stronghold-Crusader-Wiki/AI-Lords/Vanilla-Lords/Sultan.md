## Backstory & Personality
The Sultan is a kind and poetic ruler who prefers building beautiful gardens to waging war. He treats his people well and fights only when necessary, but his wealth and large population make him a capable commander.

## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a more detailed analysis of the Sultan's AIC parameters and build order.

### Economy
The Sultan has a very strong and stable economy. He focuses on a wide variety of food production and keeps his popularity high with low taxes and gardens. He avoids "bad" things and never builds torture devices.

### Military
His army is primarily defensive. He uses large numbers of Slingers and Arabian Swordsmen. He is one of the few AIs to make good use of Healers. He rarely launches large-scale attacks, preferring to build up his defenses.

### Castle Design
The Sultan builds large, sprawling, and beautifully decorated castles. They feature many gardens and are often less militarily optimized than other lords' castles, but their sheer size can make them difficult to attack.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Booming Economy:** His economic power allows him to field large numbers of troops if given enough time.
* **High Popularity:** He can support a very large population.

### Weaknesses
* **Passive:** He is not very aggressive and can often be left alone for most of the game.
* **Weak Military Composition:** His reliance on slingers makes his army less effective against heavily armored troops.
