## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of Nizar's AIC parameters and build order.
The Nizar is a silent and deadly master of stealth. His entire strategy revolves around the use of Assassins. He builds a solid economy to fund his expensive troops and then launches massive, coordinated attacks with dozens of Assassins. They will scale your walls, capture your gatehouses, and kill your lord before you know what's happening.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Devastating Assassin Attacks:** Can overwhelm defenses that are not prepared for stealth units.
* **Can Bypass Walls:** His primary unit ignores walls, making traditional defenses less effective.

### Weaknesses
* **Extremely Vulnerable to Archers:** A good perimeter of archers or crossbowmen can detect and kill his assassins easily.
* **No Siege Capability:** He has no way to deal with heavily fortified gatehouses or towers if his assassins are detected.
