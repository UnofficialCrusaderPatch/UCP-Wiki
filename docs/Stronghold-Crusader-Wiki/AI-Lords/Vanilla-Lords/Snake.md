## Backstory & Personality
The self-styled Duc Beauregard is an arrogant and opportunistic former governor. He prefers not to engage in fair fights, instead relying on harassing his opponents from a distance and demanding gold to fund his campaigns. He is quick to flee if a battle turns against him.

## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a more detailed analysis of the Snake's AIC parameters and build order.

### Economy
The Snake's economy is fragile. He builds a small number of Apple Orchards and Woodcutters. He often fails to build stone quarries, preferring to buy stone instead. He is infamous for constantly requesting gold from the player.

### Military
His strategy revolves around early-game harassment with Arabian Archers. He will supplement his forces with Assassins if he has the gold. He often uses Spearmen to dig a protective moat around his castle but rarely uses them for offensive purposes.

### Castle Design
The Snake builds small, weak castles, typically a square or L-shaped wooden enclosure with a few lookout towers. His primary defense is a wide moat, which can be a nuisance to cross early on.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Early Harassment:** His constant archer attacks can be very annoying if left unchecked, picking off workers and disrupting your economy.

### Weaknesses
* **Weak Economy:** He cannot sustain a long game and relies on tributes from the player.
* **Poor Defenses:** His castles are extremely vulnerable to any determined assault.
* **Cowardly:** He will often abandon his castle and flee if his keep is damaged.
