## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of Frederick's AIC parameters and build order.
Frederick is a powerful commander who puts his faith in the might of his heavy cavalry. He builds a strong economy geared towards supporting his expensive Knights. His castles are well-designed to protect his economy while he amasses his mounted forces. His main attack consists of a massive charge of Knights, which can be devastating if not countered properly.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Overwhelming Knight Charges:** Can field one of the largest forces of Knights in the game.
* **Strong Defenses:** Builds solid castles to protect himself while he builds his army.

### Weaknesses
* **Vulnerable to Pikemen:** A solid line of pikemen can decimate his primary attack force.
* **Expensive Army:** His reliance on knights makes his army costly and slow to replace.
