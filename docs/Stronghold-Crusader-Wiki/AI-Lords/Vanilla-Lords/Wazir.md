## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of the Wazir's AIC parameters and build order.
The Wazir is The Caliph perfected. He is a master of fire warfare with a powerful economy to back it up. He uses vast numbers of Slaves to light huge networks of oil trenches and fields elite Fire Throwers. His attacks are calculated to cause maximum destruction and chaos. He is one of the most dangerous lords in the game.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Overwhelming Fire Attacks:** His use of fire is strategic and on a much larger scale than The Caliph's.
* **Strong Economy:** Can afford to launch continuous, large-scale attacks.

### Weaknesses
* **Still Vulnerable to Fireproof Units:** While his armies are stronger than the Caliph's, a well-managed force of knights can still break through his lines.
* **Requires Pitch:** His entire strategy is dependent on access to pitch marshes.
