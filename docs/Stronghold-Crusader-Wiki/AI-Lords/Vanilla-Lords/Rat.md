## Backstory & Personality

The self-proclaimed "Duc de Puce" is a sniveling and opportunistic commander, thrust into a position of power he is ill-equipped to handle. Lacking any real strategic sense, the Rat relies on overwhelming his opponents with sheer numbers before they have a chance to prepare. His bravado is a thin veil for his cowardice, and he will quickly lose his nerve if his initial assault fails.

## In-Game Behavior

### Economy

The Rat's economy is simple and unsustainable. He focuses entirely on Apple Orchards for food and Woodcutters for basic resources. He has no complex production chains and will quickly run out of gold if the game lasts longer than 15 minutes. He keeps taxes low to fuel rapid population growth for his army.

### Military

His strategy is one-dimensional: recruit a massive swarm of Spearmen as fast as possible and send them in a human wave attack. He uses no other unit types and has no concept of combined arms or counters. His only goal is to Zerg rush the enemy lord.

### Castle Design

The Rat's castles are rudimentary at best. They consist of a small, poorly laid-out wooden enclosure with minimal defenses. He uses no moats, no gatehouses, and only a few lookout towers. His castles are designed to be built quickly, not to last.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### Strengths

* **Extremely Fast Rush:** The Rat can field a large army of spearmen very early in the game, catching unprepared players off guard.

### Weaknesses

* **No Staying Power:** His economy will collapse if his initial rush is repelled.
* **Easily Countered:** His entire army is composed of a single, weak unit type. A small number of Macemen or Archers on a wall can defeat his entire force.
* **Poor Defenses:** His castle offers almost no protection and can be destroyed by a small counter-attack.
