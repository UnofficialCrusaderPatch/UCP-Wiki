## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of the Marshal's AIC parameters and build order.
The Marshal is a grizzled, veteran commander and a stronger version of Richard the Lionheart. He is a master of logistics and warfare, building an incredibly powerful economy to support the most elite and expensive European army possible. He attacks with a nearly unstoppable force of Swordsmen and Knights, backed by a full complement of siege engines.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **The Ultimate European Army:** Fields massive numbers of the best units in the game.
* **Unbreakable Economy:** His economy is ruthlessly efficient and hard to disrupt.
* **Well-Designed Castles:** Builds strong, practical fortresses.

### Weaknesses
* **Very Slow:** Like The Wolf, his power is immense but takes a very long time to achieve. He is a pure late-game lord.
