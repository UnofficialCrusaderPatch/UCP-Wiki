## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of the Abbot's AIC parameters and build order.
The Abbot is a zealous and defensive commander. He builds sprawling monasteries and cathedrals, focusing his economy on producing the candles and hops needed to bless his populace and recruit his holy warriors. After a long build-up, he attacks with large groups of surprisingly tough Monks.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Strong Defenses:** Builds very strong, church-focused castles.
* **Tough Monks:** His Monks have high health and can be difficult to deal with for some unit types.

### Weaknesses
* **Very Slow:** He is one of the slowest AIs in the game, taking a long time to launch any significant attack.
* **Vulnerable to Ranged Units:** Monks are slow and have no armor, making them easy targets for archers and crossbowmen.
