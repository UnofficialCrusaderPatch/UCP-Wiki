| **Style:** | Hit-and-Run Specialist |

## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of the Emir's AIC parameters and build order.
The Emir is a master of mobile warfare. He despises static defenses and slow infantry, putting his faith entirely in the speed and firepower of his Horse Archers. He builds just enough economy to spam huge numbers of Horse Archers and sends them in massive, swirling waves to harass and destroy his opponents from all angles.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Massive Horse Archer Swarms:** Can field more Horse Archers than any other lord.
* **Extremely Mobile:** His army is constantly moving, making it difficult to pin down.

### Weaknesses
* **No Melee or Siege:** He has no answer to a well-defended castle. He cannot fight a pitched battle against heavy infantry.
* **Fragile Units:** Horse archers are fast but die quickly when caught.
