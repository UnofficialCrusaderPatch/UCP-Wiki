| **Difficulty:** | Hard (Extreme Lord) |
| **Style:** | Aggressive Knight Rusher |

## In-Game Behavior
> **TODO:** This section needs a detailed analysis of Phillip's AIC parameters and build order.
Unlike Frederick or Richard, King Phillip does not wait to build a massive late-game army. He is an aggressive commander who aims to use his Knights to strike early and decisively. He will try to overwhelm an opponent with repeated waves of Knights before they can establish anti-cavalry defenses like pikemen or moats.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Early Knight Pressure:** He attacks with knights much earlier than other European lords.
* **Relentless Aggression:** He keeps the pressure on with repeated attacks.

### Weaknesses
* **Smaller Armies:** His early attacks are not as large as the late-game armies of other lords.
* **Can Burn Out:** If his initial rushes are repelled, his economy may struggle to keep up.
