## In-Game Behavior

The Sheriff is a much more competent and dangerous version of The Pig. He uses the same combination of Macemen and Crossbowmen but with a better economy and more intelligent castle design. He taxes his people heavily to fund his large, brutal armies. He is a significant threat that should not be underestimated.

## Strengths & Weaknesses
### Strengths
* **Large, Tough Armies:** Fields huge numbers of Macemen and Crossbowmen.
* **Better Economy:** Can sustain his army production much better than The Pig.

### Weaknesses
* **Slow Units:** His army is still slow-moving and can be kited or trapped.
* **Vulnerable to Knights:** Heavy cavalry can cut through his macemen with ease.
